Files :
 - R :
   + mnt/register : used to register new ethertypes. When an ethertype handler
                    is ready, write the ethertype value to this file, as an hexadecimal
                    ascii representation, ended by newlines.
 - RW :
   + ethertypes/XXXX : files where data from received ethernet frames with the
                       corresponding ethertype will be written. Before the data
                       is a 2 byte field indicating the size of the data. Writing
                       data to these files will send the ethernet frame with the
                       right ethertype.
