Files :
 - RW :
   + the ethernet device file.
 - R :
   + mnt/register : used to register new ethertypes. When an ethertype handler
                    is ready, write the ethertype value to this file (the value
                    directly, not an ascii representation).
   + mnt/ethernet : used to send ethernet packets. A packet is a two bytes field
                    specifying the whole size of the packet, a two byte ethetype,
                    and the data.
 - W :
   + ethertypes/XXXX : files where data from received ethernet frames with the
                       corresponding ethertype will be written. Before the data
                       is a 2 byte field indicating the size of the data.
